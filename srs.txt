SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION (SRS)
LIFTERICO DELIVERY APP

1. Introduction
The Lifterico Delivery App is a smart delivery tracking and management system designed to address the challenges faced by Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), dispatch riders, and customers in Nigeria. With the rapid growth of e-commerce, social-media-based trading, and on-demand services, efficient last-mile delivery has become essential for business sustainability and customer satisfaction. However, many delivery operations in cities such as Kano still suffer from poor addressing systems, lack of transparency, unreliable communication, delayed deliveries, and frequent disputes between senders, riders, and recipients.
Lifterico aims to provide a transparent, secure, and efficient delivery solution by combining real-time GPS tracking, estimated time of arrival (ETA) prediction, proof of delivery, and integrated communication tools. The system is designed with local realities in mind, including low internet availability, informal addresses, and the need for trust and accountability.

1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document is to clearly define the functional and non-functional requirements of the Lifterico Delivery App. This document serves as a guide for developers during implementation and as a reference for project supervisors and examiners during evaluation. It ensures that all stakeholders have a common understanding of the system’s scope, behavior, and constraints.

1.2 Scope
The scope of the Lifterico system includes:
* User registration and authentication
* Delivery order creation and management
* Dispatch rider assignment
* Real-time GPS tracking and ETA updates
* Secure in-app communication (chat, call, SMS, WhatsApp integration)
* Proof of delivery capture (photo, OTP, signature)
* Notifications and alerts
* Analytics and reporting for SMEs
The system will primarily operate as a mobile application supported by a centralized backend infrastructure.
2. Overall Description
Lifterico is a mobile-first delivery management platform that connects SMEs, dispatch riders, and customers through a unified system. The application integrates third-party services such as mapping APIs, SMS gateways, and push notification services. It supports role-based access control to ensure that each user type can only access features relevant to their role.
The system is designed to be scalable, secure, and adaptable to low-bandwidth environments commonly found in developing regions.

Design and Implementation of Lifterico: A Smart Delivery Tracking System
1. Introduction
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) play a vital role in Nigeria’s economic development by providing employment opportunities and supporting local commerce. Despite their importance, many SMEs face serious logistics challenges, particularly in last-mile delivery. Inefficient delivery systems result in delays, customer dissatisfaction, loss of trust, and reduced business growth.
2. Background of the Study
With the increasing use of mobile technology and online marketplaces, customers now expect fast, transparent, and reliable delivery services. However, many existing delivery solutions in Nigeria lack real-time tracking, effective communication, and accountability mechanisms. This gap creates an opportunity for a system like Lifterico.
3. Problem Statement
In cities such as Kano, SMEs and customers frequently experience delayed deliveries, lack of real-time delivery visibility, poor rider-customer communication, and delivery disputes. These issues reduce customer confidence and negatively impact business operations.
4. Aim and Objectives
Aim:
To design and implement a smart delivery tracking system that improves transparency and efficiency in delivery operations.
Objectives:
* To provide real-time delivery tracking
* To enable secure communication between stakeholders
* To improve dispatch rider efficiency
* To support SMEs with analytics and reporting
5. Significance of the Study
The implementation of Lifterico will help SMEs manage deliveries more effectively, improve customer trust, reduce disputes, and promote digital transformation in local logistics operations.
6. Scope of the Project
The project focuses on the design and development of a mobile-based delivery management system that includes order creation, tracking, communication, proof of delivery, and reporting.
7. Methodology
An Agile software development methodology will be adopted. The project will follow iterative phases including requirement analysis, system design, implementation, testing, and evaluation.
8. Expected Outcome
The expected outcome is a scalable, secure, and user-friendly delivery platform capable of supporting SMEs, dispatch riders, and customers in Nigerian cities.
9. Conclusion
Lifterico aims to modernize last-mile delivery by leveraging technology to provide transparency, trust, and efficiency. The system has the potential to significantly improve logistics operations for SMEs and enhance customer satisfaction.
